# LAB 5 - AWS Secrets Manager
#### Creating a Role for your EC2 instance
In order to use Secrets Manager and for our instance to be able to access other the secret we will need to create a EC2 IAM role for our instance.

So lets proceed to the IAM console and create the role. Use the search bar and type "IAM"

1) Once you are on the  IAM page on the left hand side of the console click on SubnetRouteTableAssociation

And then click on **Create role**

2) In the subsequent screen select EC2 because our EC2 instance will need to access the Secrets Manager service and click on **Next: Permissions**

7) Now it is time to attach the role to our EC2 instance. So please go to the EC2 console. Use the search bar if you don't know where to find the service.

8) Go to your instance list and select your instance and click on **Actions -> Instance Settings -> Attach/Replace IAM Role**

2) In the Cloud9 environment drag and drop the Key Pair created at the beginning of this prerequisites lab and save it.

![images](images/cloud9keypair.png)

3) In the command prompt key in the following command:

```
chmod 400 [the name of your keypair]

ssh -i "[the name of your keypair]" ubuntu@[IP address of the  - can be found in the Cloudformation Output]

```
**:heavy_exclamation_mark: Replace the keypair name and IP address values with the ones that you use in the previous steps**

4) Once you are connected to the instances go to the **/var/www/unicorn-app**

```
cd /var/www/unicorn-appear

```
and open up **app.py**

```
sudo nano app.py

```
5) In the file you will notice that there are some commented lines using #. Go ahead and uncomment them as instructed in the file and comment the following two lines:

```
#param=yaml.load(open('param.yaml'))

```
and

```
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql://'+param['mysql_user']+':'+param['mysql_password']+'@'+param['mysql_host']+'/'+param['mysql_db']

```
See a sample here
