### Deploy the CloudFormation template for the sample application "Unicorn Adoption Site"

1) Download the cloudformation template from <a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andyliza/AWS-security-workshop-200-EN/master/CloudFormation/securityworkshop.template">this link</a>. Just simply right click on the link and select *Save Link As*. Store the file on your computer as we will need it in the next steps.

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: It will take around 10-15 minutes to have the entire template deployed**

7) Once the stack is deployed successfully click on the **Output** tab and take note the values listed there. You can copy them into a scratch pad.

10) In the command prompt key in the following command:

```
chmod 400 [the name of your keypair]

ssh -i "[the name of your keypair]" ubuntu@[IP address of the webserver - can be found in the Cloudformation Output]

```
**:heavy_exclamation_mark: Replace the keypair name and IP address values with the ones that you use in the previous steps**

11) Once you are connected key in and execute the following commands:

```
cd /var/www/unicorn-app/SQLScripts/

mysql -h [The RDS endpoint given in the Cloudformation output ] -u admin -p < setup.sql

```
Once prompted for the Aurora MySQL server password, key in "securityworkshop" and wait for 7 seconds for the setup to completed.

12) Once the setup is complete and no error is prompted, edit the __param.yaml__ located in /var/www/unicorn-app and add the RDS endpoint displayed in the Outputs of Cloudformation

```
sudo nano /var/www/unicorn-app/param.yaml

```

13) Press CTRL+X and 'Y' to Save the parameters

14) For the changes to take effect we need to restart the nginx and gunicorn3 services:

```
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn3
sudo systemctl restart nginx

```

15) Once the services are started in the Outputs of the CloudFormation template you will see the URL of our webapp.

16) Click on it and test if you can add a unicorn.

18) Feel Free to add more unicorns in the list :) so we can play later.


When you see that the operation has been completed successfully move to the [first lab (CloudTrail)](../01-CloudTrail-Lab/README.md)
